# HEART VIS

Georgia Tech's [Design & Social Interaction Studio](http://designstudio.gatech.edu/index.html) is interested in exploring experimental ways to visualize heart rate (BPM), respiration (RPM), and galvanic skin response (GSR).
Read more about Heart Sense [here](http://designstudio.gatech.edu/heart.html).

This Processing project generates a set of random biometric data and four unique ways to visualize it.


# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Press 0, 1, 2, or 3 to view the different visualizations
2. Press R to replay the visualization
3. Press N to generate a new set of data
4. Exact numerical values of BPM, RPM, and GSR can be viewed in the console


# NOTES

* The default number of data points is 30, but this can be changed in Line 1 of HeartVis.pde
* This project uses a [random seed](https://processing.org/reference/randomSeed_.html), which can be edited in Line 2 of HeartVis.pde
* An example of the data produced by seed 33 and the screenshots of its visualizations are in the folder "/examples".
